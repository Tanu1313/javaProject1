## Project Overview
**DocImprint ** is a high-performance desktop application engineered for efficient PDF management, with a core focus on secure and customizable PDF stamping. Developed using Java and the **Apache NetBeans IDE**, StampIt empowers users to brand and protect their digital documents with unparalleled ease and speed.


## Features

  * **PDF Watermarking/Stamping:** Add semi-transparent text, images, or patterns to PDF documents.
  * **Customizable Stamps:** Support for using custom images as stamps.
  * **Security & Authentication:** Enhance document security by embedding identifiable information.
  * **Intellectual Property Protection:** Safeguard copyrighted material with clear markings.

## Technologies Used
**Languag**e: Java
**IDE**: Apache NetBeans
**PDF Library**: iText7-core 7.2.3

## How it Works

The "PDF Stamper" utilizes the **iText7-core** library (version 7.2.3) in Java to programmatically manipulate PDF documents. The core functionality involves reading an existing PDF and adding an image (the stamp/watermark) to specified positions on each page, with adjustable opacity.

### Core Logic (Simplified)

The `PdfStamp` class contains the `addWatermarkToPdf` method, which takes the input PDF path, output PDF path, and watermark image file path as arguments. It iterates through each page of the input PDF, creates an `Image` object from the watermark image, sets its position and opacity, and then adds it to the document.

## Usage

To use the PDF Stamper (assuming you have the compiled Java code and necessary libraries):

1.  **Prepare your PDF:** Ensure you have the PDF document you wish to stamp (e.g., `document.pdf`).
2.  **Prepare your stamp image:** Have an image file (e.g., `stamp.jpg`) that you want to use as a stamp.
3.  **Run the application:** Execute the `Texxt.java` file. The application will process `document.pdf` and generate `output.pdf` with the `stamp.jpg` applied.

**Example Code Snippet:**

```java
public class Texxt {
    public static void main (String [] args) {
        PdfStamp pdfStamp = new PdfStamp();
        // This will stamp "document.pdf" with "stamp.jpg" and save as "output.pdf"
        pdfStamp.addWatermarkToPdf("document.pdf", "output.pdf", "stamp.jpg");
    }
}
```

## Applications

The "PDF Stamper" can be applied in various scenarios:

  * **Document Status Updates:** Mark documents as "In Review," "Approved," or "Draft."
  * **Confidentiality Marking:** Indicate confidentiality levels like "Confidential" or "For Internal Use Only."
  * **Copyright Protection:** Stamp copyrighted material with watermarks or notices.
  * **Date and Time Stamping:** Add timestamps for record-keeping.
  * **Company Branding:** Incorporate company logos or trademarks for branding.
  * **Quality Management:** Ensure compliance in regulated industries by appropriately marking documents.

## Conclusion and Future Scope

"PDF Stamper" serves as a fundamental tool for securing digital content by enabling the addition of unique identifying marks to PDF documents. It significantly contributes to maintaining document authenticity and protecting intellectual property rights.

In the future, the project could be enhanced by:

  * **Advanced Encryption:** Implementing stronger encryption techniques for even greater security.
  * **Blockchain Integration:** Utilizing blockchain technology for transparent and tamper-proof stamping records.
  * **Artificial Intelligence:** Automating the stamping process further for increased efficiency.
  * **Improved Mobile Compatibility:** Enhancing support for stamping documents on mobile devices.
  * **Expanded Customization:** Offering more options for customizing stamps.
  * **Seamless DMS Integration:** Integrating with document management systems for improved workflow.

This project lays a solid foundation for robust digital document security, with exciting possibilities for future development.
